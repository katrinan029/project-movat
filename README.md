# PROJECT MOVAT
Project Movat explores the obesity epidemic in the United States. 
This study uses county-level data to look for relationships in data on seven indicators that can be theoretically linked to obesity rates in order to attempt to predict how obesity rates vary bsed on these indicators. 

## BACKGROUND
The obesity epidemic in the United States is an open secret; and a persistent butt of jokes and internet memes. It has gotten so
bad that American food companies have ended up up exporting this health crisis to developing nations in Asia. Wth the advent of government-subsidized health insurance and the costsassociated with comorbidities exacerbated by the condition, obesity can no longer be simply dismissed as merely a personal problem; it is now imperative to treat it as a public-health issue
 
## SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS

## METHODOLOGY
* THE MULTIPLE REGRESSION METHOD
* Matplotlib for plotting data
* API Requests for gathering data
* Pandas

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

### CONCLUSIONS
The layman's understanding of the obesity epidemic is an oversimplified abstraction. 
Obesity cannot be simply associated with one factor or another, whether social or health-related. 
It may turnout that solutions to the obesity epidemic require a nuanced understanding 
of the interactions that occur between multiple contributory variables. While access to exercise oppurtunities was 
found to have consistently robust predictive relationship with obesity rates 
(around a .5 percentage decrease in obesity for every additional percentage with access to exercise oppurtunities once other predictors are controlled for.),  
this relationship is also mediated by theinactivity rates of adults ina county. Similar interactions were plotted for various combinations of predictors. 

### RECOMMENDATIONS
A goverbment commited to fighting the obesity epidemic may ask how to best combtat this public health crisis. The truth is that Project Movat cannot answer this question definitively. 
The best that can be said is that this prject has laid out a map for which variables have strong correlations with obesity rates; and that more dedicated researchers might examine whether these correlatons translate to causal relationships. 
Without proper research on causality, Project Movat will sadly not be helpful in informing public policy.For everything that has been said, any effort to parse conclusions out of regressions that display substantial interaction effects 
should  approach these findings with appropriate caution.
